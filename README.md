# Unity Developer Console
Preparing a console for Unity for any project with basic capabilities.

Hi, I'm Marc Baqués Sàbat a game development student in ENTI, Barcelona.

I'm programming a console to execute at runtime in Unity to use for my own projects. My plan is to publish this asset as free in Unity asset store in the near future.

Feel free to ask or comment any question that you have.
