# Unity Developer Console
Preparing a console for Unity for any project with basic capabilities.

Hi, I'm Marc Baqués Sàbat a game development student in ENTI, Barcelona.

I'm programming a console to execute at runtime in Unity to use for my own projects. My plan is to publish this asset as free in Unity asset store in the near future.
Fully resizable and movable on screen, i plan to let the user customize the look of the console, colors, font, size... on a settings panel.

Basic commands:<br />
-Load scene<br />
-Time scale<br />
-Active/Disactive GameObjects by:<br />
  -Tag<br />
  -Name<br />
  -Component<br />
-Help<br />
-Description<br />
-Clear<br />
-Quit<br />

Feel free to ask, comment or suggest anything.
